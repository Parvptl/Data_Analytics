# Lab 3 – Fundamentals, Statistics & Correlation Analysis (R)

## Objective
Perform basic data analysis and statistical computations in R using real-world and synthetic datasets.

## Tasks

### Part I – Fundamentals and Measures of Central Tendency
1. Load the **Cereals dataset** and inspect its structure and top rows.  
2. Compute the **average calorie value** of cereals.  
3. Identify cereals with the **maximum and minimum ratings**.  
4. Determine the **most frequent manufacturer** of cereals.

### Part II – Statistical Measures (Manual and Built-in)
1. Calculate the **range** of a numeric vector manually and using R’s `range()` function.  
2. Compute the **standard deviation** of a numeric dataset manually using the formula and verify using `sd()`.  
3. Calculate the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** manually and verify using `IQR()`.

### Part III – Correlation Analysis
1. Find the **Pearson correlation coefficient** between calories and ratings.  
2. Interpret the nature of correlation (positive/negative/none).  
3. Test whether the correlation is **statistically significant at the 5% level**.

## Key Concepts
- Reading CSV files in R  
- Descriptive statistics (mean, max, min, range, standard deviation, IQR)  
- Frequency computation using `table()`  
- Correlation and hypothesis testing in R  

## Tools Used
- R Programming Language  
- Base R Functions: `read.csv()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `min()`, `cor()`, `cor.test()`  
- Statistical operations using built-in and manual formulas  

## Output
- Descriptive summary of the cereals dataset  
- Computed statistical measures (Range, SD, IQR)  
- Correlation coefficient and hypothesis test result for cereals data
