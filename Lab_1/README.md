# Lab 1 – Python Basics and NumPy

## Objective
Learn Python fundamentals, explore array operations using NumPy, and perform basic data visualization with Matplotlib.

## Tasks
1. Implemented Python constructs – loops, conditions, and functions.  
2. Worked with lists and dictionaries for computation.  
3. Performed NumPy operations:
   - Array creation, reshaping, slicing  
   - Element-wise arithmetic and aggregation  
   - Logical indexing and replacement  
4. Visualized data using Matplotlib (line and bar charts).

## Key Concepts
- Python syntax & control structures  
- Data structures: lists & dictionaries  
- NumPy arrays and vectorized operations  
- Basic data visualization techniques  

## Tools Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Output
- Console outputs for all Python and NumPy tasks  
- Matrix operations and computed summaries  
- Line and bar plots comparing datasets
