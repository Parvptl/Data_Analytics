## Objective
Analyze industrial, sanitation (IHHL), and culinary datasets to understand outliers, trends, and comparative insights.

### Datasets
1. Industrial Characteristics (Fixed Capital, Wages, etc.)  
2. IHHL Achievements per State  
3. Indian Food Dishes with Preparation and Cooking Times

### Key Tasks
- Compute z-scores and detect outliers (|z| ≥ 2.5)
- Apply 3-point moving averages for smoothing
- Aggregate IHHL totals and visualize scatter with red outliers
- Calculate and visualize top 8 states by average total cooking time (pie chart)

### Deliverables
- `Industrial_IHHL_Food_Analysis_Parv.ipynb` — Enhanced Jupyter Notebook  
- `README_Lab4.md` — This documentation summary

All visualizations follow a clean academic style (clear labels, fonts, and layout).
