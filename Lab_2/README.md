# Lab 2 – DataFrames and Analysis

## Objective
Work with structured data using NumPy, pandas, and JSON. Explore data generation, manipulation, and analysis using Python data-handling libraries.

## Tasks
### Part I – NumPy and pandas Basics
1. Generate random datasets using NumPy (normal, uniform, and categorical data).  
2. Create and save a pandas DataFrame using generated arrays.  
3. Perform data analysis — mean, variance, categorical counts, and department-wise summaries.

### Part II – COMPAS Dataset Analysis
1. Load the COMPAS dataset and explore its structure.  
2. Perform age and race-based analyses.  
3. Compute category frequencies and averages using pandas operations.

### Part III – Weather Data Analysis (JSON)
1. Load multi-city weather data from JSON.  
2. Filter data based on longitude and humidity criteria.  
3. Convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and compute temperature ranges.  
4. Identify city/date with the highest temperature range and compute per-city averages.

## Key Concepts
- NumPy array generation and random sampling  
- pandas DataFrame creation, I/O, and aggregation  
- Data filtering, grouping, and descriptive statistics  
- JSON data handling and conversion to structured DataFrame

## Tools Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- pandas  
- JSON

## Output
- Generated datasets and saved DataFrame (`employee_data.csv`)  
- Analytical insights from COMPAS dataset  
- Processed and filtered weather data (derived from JSON)
